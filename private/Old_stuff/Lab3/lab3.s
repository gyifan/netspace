# This program calculates the sum of the values in array A and counts
# the number of values in the array.
#
# Similarly to a C-string, the array is terminated by sentinel value
# equal to zero.
#
# The sum is stored in $s0 and the count in $s1

	.data
A:	.word 5 4 3 2 4 1 0	# declare array int A[]={5,4,3,2,4,1,0};

	.text	
main:				# This symbols marks the first instruction of your program

#
# Add your code here
#

	li	$v0, 10		# system call for exit
	syscall			# Exit!
