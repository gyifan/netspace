WARNING: [Place 30-673] PLL instance "vga_i/PLLE2_BASE_inst" has outputs that directly drive clock pins without going through clock buffers first. This might lead to an unroutable placement if the clock loads aren't grouped into a single clock region. If unintended, please define a clock buffer (BUFG/BUFH) for the PLL outputs to avoid clock placement issues.
